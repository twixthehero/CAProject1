<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The main goal with this project was to create 3d artwork based off of Conway's Game of Life.
With the pseudo-randomness of the rules (such that humans are not easliy capable
of reproducing the same exact results), each time the simulation is run, a
very unique outcome is reached.</p>
<h3>Design Choices</h3>
<p>The major design choices I made were which options to allow the user to control.
Allowing the user to change the number of cells was an important decision because
users might not be able to run with lots of cells, or they may have a supercomputer
capable of running thousands of cells. The height option was added in order to
allow for the isolation of cells that aren't completely dead (or have been for quite
some time). Wireframe mode was allowed in order to see the individual cells better.
Using solid colors made it too difficult to see the cells changing at certain camera angles
because there is no realistic lighting in the scene. A pause button was added to
allow for instant pausing of the simulation in case a certain feature was reached
and a still shot was needed.</p>
<p>In the event that the simulation reaches a standstill or reaches a point where
future generations will be the same, the randomize button can be pushed to
recreate the board randomly.</p>
<p>Regarding color, I chose a bright blue for alive cells in order to draw your
attention straight to them. The dead cells use an off-white which can optionally
be turned down even more to show off the live cells.</p>
